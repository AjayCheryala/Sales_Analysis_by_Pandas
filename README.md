# Sales_Analysis_by_Pandas
A notebook that carries out analysis on Sales data. In this project, I used Python Pandas &amp; Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 monthsâ€™ worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.
