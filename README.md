# Sales_Analysis_by_Pandas

A notebook that carries out analysis on Sales data. 

In this project, I used Python Pandas &amp; Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months’ worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.


I have answered these 5 questions through my data analysis mainly using pandas and matplotlib library.

1.	What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
